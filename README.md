# Course Data

This project cleans and analyzes enrollment and evaluation data from my past courses.

## Dependencies

- `R` and several `R` packages
- `make`

## Usage

- Drop course enrollment CSV files in `data/enrollments` directory. 
- Drop evaluation PDF files (the "Responses" ones, not the "Summary" ones) into `/data/evaluations`.
- Run `make` from the top of the directory.
- Your report should show up in the `output` directory.
